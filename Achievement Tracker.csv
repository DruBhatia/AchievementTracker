100% Completion,Games I either finished or I no longer regularly play,Games to attempt are ones I am interested in and plan to play for the first time soon. Whether or not I reach 100% completion is unknown but the games have been selected to have reasonable chances of this occurring naturally,,,,,,,,,,,,,
90-100% Completion,Games I regularly play (or wish to play),"Games to 100% soon are ones I already have high completion in, am still interested in playing, and/or have easy remaining achievements that I do not need to spend significant time or effort to collect",,,,,,,,,,,,,
80-90% Completion,Games that do not appear in library,"Games to 100% eventually are those that I still have some at least some interest in and that have significant, but doable amounts of content remaining. 100%ing these games is a long term goal I may achieve over several months/years of gameplay",,,,,,,,,,,,,
70-80% Completion,Games in active service,"Games to never 100% are those that I have never attempted/have played a lot and gotten bored of/can no longer play due to issues with Steam/servers/whatever, and am not interested in playing at all, or are perpetually active service titles that constantly receive so many content updates it is impossible to keep track of them",,,,,,,,,,,,,
60-70% Completion,Old games that are delisted or unsupported in store,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
50-60% Completion,Games that were played during promotional events,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
40-50% Completion,Games I am particularly interested in increasing my completion for (but not necessarily to 100%),,,,,,,,,,,,,,
